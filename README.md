### R65 Assembler

Made in *GCC*.

The parsing and writing are incomplete. The code is very unorganized and not ideal at this stage. 

*To run*: the only argument required is a path to the assembly file. There is a test file at the project root.

Parses R65 assembly and outputs a ROM. Your Assembly must have "__R65A__"  signed at the start of the file.

*Warning*: as of now, this is very sloppy, unoptimized code. It works, but is not by any means pretty. It will not stay like this.
